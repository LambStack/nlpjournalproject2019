0. explore IBM API, lots of options

1. way to evaluate application
  a. gold standard corpus
  b. scoring

  https://yohasebe.com/tcse great resource because they're speech transcriptions, can search by term

  
  https://github.com/sumehta/question-generation very good automatic question/answer generation

  start with automatically generate "WH" (who, what when, where, why(?)) question/answer pairs ??

  MTurk the rest

  how far do we need to test at all?

2. will need to code up journal specific queries 'tell me about X', 'what did I say about 4 yesterday?'
    identify list of top 15(?) journal app queries
    mapping this to the IBM query language

3. neat GUI app on top

4. optimize corpus organization for IBM collection, would detecting top entity and mapping into specific
  .html file make any sense?
